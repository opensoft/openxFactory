"""Feature `sequenced-after-integrity` (add-sequenced-after-substrate tasks
5.4-5.5): the CORPUS SWEEP as a shipped, RE-RUNNABLE report.

A one-off measurement recorded in prose ages into a stale sentence. The sweep is
what makes the "measured, not assumed" obligation of the "Chain-walk policy
belongs to the consumer, and its bound SHALL be measured" requirement DISCHARGE
OVER TIME: it reports the population, the co-modified / sole-modifier split at
requirement granularity, adoption of the field, and THE DEEPEST DECLARED CHAIN it
resolves.

The reading of the live corpus is asserted here against the AUTHORING measurement
recorded in the ratified proposal, so a drift in either the corpus or the
counting method surfaces as a test failure rather than as a number nobody
re-derives.
