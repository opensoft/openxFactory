# openxFactory

`openxFactory` documents the domain-neutral xFactory workflow rail used by Opensoft domain factory projects.

It defines reusable contracts for:

- workflow gates
- state transitions
- traceability
- routing
- approval handoffs
- review records
- audit expectations
- authority boundaries between governance, workflow, execution, and enforcement layers

## Core Boundary

`openxFactory` is domain-neutral.

```text
Hermes
  owns intent, policy, memory, approval, and governance history.

openxFactory / xFactory
  owns contracts, gates, traceability, routing, state transitions, and audit.

Domain factory repos
  own domain-specific execution behavior.

Domain Omnigent layers
  run bounded domain agents under Hermes policy and openxFactory gates.

External enforcement systems
  enforce final state where applicable.
```

Domain examples:

```text
opencodexFactory
  uses Omnigent to run coding and engineering agents.

MedxFactory
  uses Omnigent to run clinical and medical reasoning agents.

OpsxFactory
  uses Omnigent to run sysops, devops, and IT administration agents.
```

## Domain Implementations

- `opensoft/opencodexFactory` — software, code, repo, and engineering xFactory domain stack.
- `opensoft/MedxFactory` — medical xFactory domain stack for clinical agents and medical workflows.
- `opensoft/OpsxFactory` — IT operations, sysops, devops, identity, infrastructure, and tenant administration xFactory domain stack.

## Install Repo Pins

`openxFactory` pins approved install repo revisions under `installs/` when needed.

Current submodules:

- [installs/omnigent-install](installs/omnigent-install) -> `opensoft/Omnigent-Install`

Clone or refresh with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Hermes install is not yet a submodule. Its canonical remote decision is still open; see [Decision 0001](docs/decisions/0001-install-repo-submodules.md).

## Status

This repository is documentation-first. It should not contain live credentials, production memory-provider databases, runtime secrets, generated agent workspaces, or domain-specific runtime data.
