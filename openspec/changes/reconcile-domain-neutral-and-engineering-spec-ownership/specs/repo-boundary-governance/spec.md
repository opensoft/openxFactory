## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Canonical workflow authority
`openxFactory` SHALL be the canonical repository for domain-neutral factory
workflow policy, authority rules, role definitions, traceability rules,
admission concepts, merge authority concepts, and cross-system operating
contracts. Domain-specific execution policy SHALL live in the owning
DomainxFactory.

#### Scenario: Factory policy is introduced
- **WHEN** a new policy affects Hermes, Omnigent/Polly, OpenSpec, GitHub, merge council behavior, or more than one DomainxFactory at the domain-neutral workflow layer
- **THEN** the canonical policy MUST be created or updated in `openxFactory`

#### Scenario: Domain execution policy is introduced
- **WHEN** a policy defines software engineering Spec Kit mechanics, clinical review mechanics, operations runbook execution, accounting close workflow execution, marketing campaign execution, or another domain-specific workflow implementation
- **THEN** the canonical implementation policy MUST be created or updated in the owning DomainxFactory
- **AND** `openxFactory` MUST reference it only as a specialization of neutral workflow gates

#### Scenario: Install repo needs policy context
- **WHEN** `Hermes-Install` or `Omnigent-Install` needs to implement a factory policy
- **THEN** the install repo MUST link to the canonical `openxFactory` policy for neutral workflow concerns
- **AND** it MUST link to the owning DomainxFactory policy when implementing domain-specific execution behavior
