## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Deterministic check families
The doc-health deterministic pass SHALL implement twelve check families
over the whole factory family's governance corpus: status validity,
standard backing, ratified provenance, succession integrity, location
conformance, record immutability, staged/candidate aging,
register-lifecycle consistency, tag hygiene, submodule pin drift,
contract-copy drift, and notebook projection drift. Every check MUST be
deterministic — identical inputs produce identical findings, with no model
calls; semantic sweeps are out of this capability's scope. Check families
SHALL implement promoted spec wording; staged ideation fragments are inputs
to contracts, never check definitions.

#### Scenario: A run executes the check families
- **WHEN** a doc-health run executes
- **THEN** every check family MUST run over every family repo the aggregation repo pins (openxFactory and each DomainxFactory), plus the per-repo validators as a preflight
- **AND** a family that cannot run (e.g. notebook drift without credentials) MUST be reported as skipped, never silently omitted

#### Scenario: Lifecycle conformance checks fire
- **WHEN** a governance document violates a `document-lifecycle` rule — a free-form or missing `Status:` value, an unbacked `standard` claim, a dangling `Ratified by:` reference, a `superseded` doc without a successor, a `brainstorm` doc outside `ideation/brainstorm/`, a `staged` doc that is outside `ideation/staging/` and is not a candidate register (`Kind: register`), or a content edit to a `record` doc after capture
- **THEN** the run MUST emit a finding naming the check family, the repo, the path, and the violated rule

#### Scenario: A register carries staged status
- **WHEN** a candidate register (`Kind: register`) carries `Status: staged` outside `ideation/staging/`
- **THEN** location conformance MUST NOT emit a finding — registers are a promoted organized-state home per the `document-lifecycle` capability

#### Scenario: Drift checks fire
- **WHEN** a submodule pin lags its remote main, a contract copy diverges from its canonical source, or the lifecycle notebook projection dry-run reports nonzero add/update/delete operations
- **THEN** the run MUST emit a drift finding identifying what diverged and from which source of truth

### Requirement: Finding severity and regression handling
Every finding SHALL carry one severity from `critical` (governance
integrity broken), `error` (contract violation), `warning` (drift or
first-stage aging), or `info` (inventory and metrics); one resolution class
from `auto-fixable` (mechanical defect: malformed marker, broken link,
missing header, formatting) or `contested` (resolution would change a
deliberately-set state, arbitrate between rules, or reverse a prior gate
decision); and a regression — any `critical` or `error` finding not present
in the previous report, matched by check family and path — MUST open a
single issue per run in the aggregation repo listing the new findings.

#### Scenario: A new error-level finding appears
- **WHEN** a run emits a `critical` or `error` finding absent from the previous report
- **THEN** one issue for the run MUST be opened in the aggregation repo listing all such new findings

#### Scenario: Findings persist unchanged
- **WHEN** a finding present in the previous report recurs
- **THEN** it MUST appear in the report and plan but MUST NOT open or duplicate an issue

#### Scenario: A contested finding is resolved
- **WHEN** a finding classified `contested` stops appearing between consecutive reports
- **THEN** its resolution MUST cite an OpenSpec change or a recorded human disposition against the finding id
- **AND** a contested finding that disappears via a state or status change with no such citation MUST be emitted as a new `error` finding ("uncited resolution") naming the original finding

#### Scenario: A session works a report's plan
- **WHEN** a session resolves ranked-plan items from a report
- **THEN** it MAY apply `auto-fixable` items directly
- **AND** it MUST NOT apply state-changing edits for `contested` items — those are escalated for a change proposal or human disposition

#### Scenario: The headline metric declines
- **WHEN** canon share by words drops between runs
- **THEN** the decline is trend data in the report, not a regression — no issue is opened for it alone
